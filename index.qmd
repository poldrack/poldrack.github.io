## About me

I'm a cognitive neuroscientist who uses brain imaging to study how the brain gives rise to the mind.  I'm also deeply interested in improving the way that science is done, by providing researchers with tools and knowledge to help them do research that is more reproducible and more transparent.

I received my BA in Psychology from Baylor University and my PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.  After doing a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University, I held faculty positions at Harvard Medical School, UCLA, and the University of Texas at Austin.  I'm currently the Albert Ray Lang Professor of Psychology at Stanford University.  You can learn more about the work that my lab does from our lab web site, [poldracklab.org](https://www.poldracklab.org).  We also have an [online lab manual](https://poldracklab.github.io) that outlines our polices and standard operating procedures, as well as my mentoring philosophy.

I am also an Associate Director for [Stanford Data Science](https://datascience.stanford.edu/), and Director of the [Center for Open and Reproducible Science](https://cores.stanford.edu/). 

I've published several books:

- [Statistical Thinking: Analyzing Data in an Uncertain World](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691250939/statistical-thinking)
- [Hard to Break: Why Our Brains Make Habits Stick](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691194325/hard-to-break)
- [The New Mind Readers: What Neuroimaging Can and Cannot Reveal about Our Thoughts](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691178615/the-new-mind-readers)
- [Handbook of fMRI Data Analysis (with Jeanette Mumford and Tom Nichols)](https://sites.google.com/site/fmridataanalysis/home)
