In the spirit of&nbsp;Chris Guillebeau's <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/how-to-conduct-your-own-annual-review/">Annual Review</a>, I decided to take a few minutes this morning to review what worked well and what didn't 2011 and look forward to 2012.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Goals:</span><br /><br />Last year I set <a href="http://www.russpoldrack.org/2011/01/goals-for-new-year.html">three goals for 2011</a>. &nbsp;Here's how they fared.<br /><br /><b>FAIL:</b><i> Work toward a travel moratorium for 2012</i>. &nbsp;This started with me responding to all requests with "I'm sorry, but I'm not traveling at all for work in 2012." &nbsp;At some point that became untenable, and the floodgates opened. &nbsp;At this point, I am still planning to travel less in 2012 than in 2011, but will still probably take 8-10 trips.<br /><br /><b>SUCCESS</b>: <i>Improve climbing skills well enough to lead climb</i>. My climbing skills have improved enormously over the last year, and in the summer I began lead climbing at the rock gym, where I can now lead a number of routes in the 5.9 range. &nbsp;I was not able to lead outside, mostly because the weather in December did not cooperate, but I plan to do so very soon.<br /><br /><b>SUCCESS</b>:&nbsp;<i>No new web projects</i>. I only purchased one new domain name this year, and that was for a project that had been hatched in 2010. &nbsp;We have instead focused heavily on our existing projects, particularly <a href="http://openfmri.org/">openfmri.org</a>. <br /><br />Here are my goals for 2012:<br /><br /><i>Improve my posture</i>. &nbsp;Some nagging neck and back issues this year have highlighted the need to improve my posture. &nbsp;Who knows, I might even <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10457761">get some mental benefits from it as well</a>.<br /><br /><i>Improve my code management</i>. &nbsp;In the last year I have started integrating source code management (using git) into my workflow (see <a href="https://github.com/poldrack">my github repo</a> for a tour of some of my adventures during the last year). &nbsp;However, it still has not become a habit for me during everyday coding. <br /><br /><i>Exercise on every trip</i>. &nbsp;One of the reasons that I find travel so disruptive is that it interferes with my fitness routine. &nbsp;I carry my yoga mat on nearly every trip, and this year I did a fairly good job of exercising while on the road, but I was not very consistent. &nbsp;Next year I plan to make sure that I get some exercise on every trip, even if it's just some burpees and squats in the hotel room. <br /><br />I hope it's not true that <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19389130">making these goals public will make them harder to achieve</a>!<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Stats</span><br /><br />Countries visited: 7<br />Miles flown: 76,162<br />Talks given: 12<br />Papers published: 14<br />Grants funded: 2<br /><br />Property crimes (committed against me, not by me): 2<br /><div><br /></div><br />Best meals:<br />1. Tasting menu at <a href="http://congressaustin.com/congress/">Congress</a><br />2. Lunch at <a href="http://www.les-arcenaulx.com/">Les Arcenuax, Marseille</a><br />3. Tie between <a href="http://franklinbarbecue.com/">Franklin BBQ</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://jmuellerbbq.com/">JMueller BBQ</a><br />4. Tasting menu at <a href="http://www.uchiaustin.com/">Uchi</a> (the meal that sealed our transition to full-blown carnivores)

Great post. Do you think a standing desk might help with the posture issues, since (i presume) so much of your day is spent at a keyboard?

**Russ Poldrack said on 2011-12-31**

probably would help - In fact, I have started standing at work whenever I can (e.g. conference calls).

Saddle chairs are a good way to improve posture &amp; ergonomics. pricey but a good investment given time spent on computer: http://www.haginc.com/products/hag-capisco/
