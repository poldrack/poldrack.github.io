I remember the SE/30--I came over and spent the day at the Nutty Pecan putting my history paper together. (I got an A on it with the comment &quot;Pretty good&quot; from the prof.) Good times.

In 1993 you asked me if you should buy a computer or go to Europe.  I told you computers were like sex -- you shouldn't have to pay for them.  You came to Europe...

That was great advice Gordon!
